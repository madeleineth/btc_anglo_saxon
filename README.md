An Android dictionary of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) based on Joseph Bosworth's
1898 "An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary" and the 1921 supplement by Northcote Toller
(a.k.a. "Bosworth–Toller"). It uses [Ondřej Tichý's morphological
generator](https://github.com/madeleineth/tichy_oe_generator) to allow
searching inflected forms. It supports full-text search of entries, so you can
also search for Anglo-Saxon phrases and Modern English terms.
